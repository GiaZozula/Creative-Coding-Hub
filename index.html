                <p>This is my first attempt at using spatial sound in p5.js in order to create an interactive approximation of the titular scene from the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola movie, "The Conversation" (1974).</p>

                    <li>Takes 10 seconds to switch from the title screen to the main game</li>
                    <li>The goal/controls are very simple, just move the mouse and attempt to hover over the conversation</li>

        <h1>Creative coding experiments + prototypes</h1>
        <p>This is a collection of unfinished prototypes that I built in order to learn how to code, before attending a bootcamp. Most of these little experiments were made using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a great tool to trick artists into becoming fascinated by programming ‚ò∫</p>
        <p>Beware: nothing is optimized here, so everything might load slowly. Also make sure to give audio access to each of these or else the sound may not load properly. Might need to refresh to make sure the tunes work.</p>

                    <a href="./the-conversation/index.html">The Conversation</a>
                </h2>
                <p>This is my first attempt at using spatial sound in p5.js in order to create an interactive approximation of the titular scene from the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola movie, "The Conversation" (1974).</p>
                <p>Notes on how to play:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It takes 10 seconds to switch from the title screen to the main game.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The goal/controls are very simple, just move the mouse and attempt to hover over the conversation.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After the conversation is over, an end screen will display.
                        </p>

                </h2>
                <p>This is a prototype of a game that aims to simulate (albiet in a reduced, gamified manner) the stress of working at a warehouse like Amazon.</p>
                <p>Notes on how to play:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        The player has to respond to orders from the boss, using conveyor belts.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Fill up the bar in the top left-hand corner and you will get to keep your job.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Do so by dragging the correct products (skulls) onto the dropzone (white area) within the time limit.
                        </p>

                For this program, I really wanted to experiment with how to lead the user in, perhaps with counterintuitive, "anti-design" methods. I'm not sure it is entirely
                successful on that point (or any other tbh), but the process of development has been very enlightening for my understanding of opaque and obscure design.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Is the page loading properly? Why is it basically blank? What's that horrible distorted drone? Why is there an awkwardly placed grey circle? Why is the cursor a cross? Is this a spreadsheet or some weird mystical thing? Is this program as terrible as it first appears?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        These are some of the questions I imagine anyone who engages with this program will have at first. Hopefully through the use of ARROW KEYS, the MOUSE, LISTENING, and LOOKING, you will be able to reuinte the two spirits.

                <p>The concept behind this prototype was to imagine what the internet could have looked like if the common standards of Web 2.0 had never taken hold. I was inspired by the early, uncertain history of the internet and the aesthetics of early personal websites. 
                <p>
                Many old, pre-flash, pre-css, pre-js websites took this almost-screensaver-like approach. I wanted to make a website that could act as a restorative place of peace and relaxation, unbound from the need to be efficient, legible, or centered around commercial concerns. 
                </p>
                In keeping with the rudimentary spirit of Web 1.0, I thought it would be a funny challenge to use as bare-bones of an html, css, and js structure as I could, with no actual game engine to speak of. As a result, this thing is broken as hell.
                </p>
                <p>
                I had a variety of ideas to add events that occurred in real time, along with hidden interactions and a day/night cycle. I may revisit this concept in the future as this was made before I knew much of anything about coding.

                            This thing is mostly broken, but you can move around with the arrow keys.

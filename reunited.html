    Is the page loading properly? Why is it basically blank? What's that horrible distorted drone? Why is there an awkwardly placed grey circle?
    Why is the cursor a cross? Is this a spreadsheet or some weird mystical thing? Is this program as terrible as it first appears?
    </p>
    <p>
    These are some of the questions I imagine anyone who engages with this program
    will have at first. Hopefully through the use of ARROW KEYS, the MOUSE,
    LISTENING, and LOOKING, you will be able to reuinte the two spirits.

    <p>Good luck!</p>
    <h2>Dear User,</h2>
    <p>
        For this program, I really wanted to experiment with how to lead the user in,
        perhaps with counterintuitive, "anti-design" methods. I'm not sure it is entirely
        successful on that point, but the process of development has been very enlightening
        for my understanding of opaque and obscure design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also wanted to wrap this experimentation in a strange, mystical package that
        draws from the cluttered and confusing HUDs of old PC games and RPGs. One thing I wish is that I had more time to develop and depict a more interesting, mythical narrative for this program.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program begins with "tutorial" and "intro" sections that are intended to
        maintain a certain level of obscurity while also informing the user of what is
        possible in this program. Namely, the use of spatial audio, the mouse, and the
        arrow keys.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "tutorial" scene is the most brutally basic thing to start off with. Its so
        rudimentary I'd say it counts as ugly. I also imagine it could likely turn most
        users away. Hopefully you won't immediately write the program off!
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I thought it was interesting to start with the most barebones version of
        what was needed in order to teach the user how to use this program, without anything
        written or explicitly stated. I also have a tendency to overload and go maximalist
        with all of the oscillating opacities and over-the-top 3D creatures. I thought
        it could be an interesting contrast to begin with the exact opposite. There is
        nothing to tell the user that they are even on a functioning website other than
        a cell cursor, some distorted audio drone, and an awkwardly placed grey circle
        off to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        My hope is that after this hyper-minimalist start, the user will be surprised
        and possibly even intrigued by the change in visual fidelity (and ongoing audio
        drone) while also having learned a fundamental lesson from the program regarding
        its use of spatial audio and the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        My intention was to continue to teach the user in the next scene as well. This
        time by asking the user to press the up arrow key within a time window of the
        gate being open.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the "game" section, I am conflicted about the end result. I like the way it
        looks. The HUD was an enormous pain in the ass to get right in terms of positioning
        but it worked out in the end. I've been wanting to try out something like that
        for a long time. However, I'm not wild about how the "game" actually plays.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish there was a 3D component in the viewport to make the top down movement
        around a rectangular playing field more interesting. If I had more time I would
        have liked to have added more complexity to the actual gameplay. I tried my best
        to add complexity to the code wherever I could, though its revealing of my skill
        level that I don't always know the best way to do that. I suppose complexity for
        complexity's sake isn't great anywho!
    </p>
    <p>
        Regrettably, I also couldn't figure out how to get my actual initial concept across.
        I would still love to make a game where the player controls two separate entities
        that are attempting to reunite, each with an entirely different POV and set of
        controls.
